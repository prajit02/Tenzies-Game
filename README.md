# Tenzies Game

## Overview
Tenzies is a fun and interactive dice game where the objective is to roll the dice until all of them show the same number. This project is built using React and JavaScript to create a smooth and engaging user experience.

## Features
- **Multiple Dice Rolls:** Players can roll the dice as many times as they need to match all dice to the same number.
- **Freeze Dice:** Players can "freeze" dice that match their desired number to avoid re-rolling them.
- **Game Timer:** Track how quickly you can match all dice!
- **Responsive Design:** Play on any device with a clean, mobile-friendly interface.
